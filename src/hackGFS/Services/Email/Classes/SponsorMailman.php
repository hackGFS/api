    | This is really a builder, but I like the idea of having a post office and a mail man
    | Basically, the highest level of our custom email. Creates an instance of the object,
    | that will then be manipulated by the subclasses UtilityMailman and SponsorMailman.
    | However, PostOffice can also send off basic emails on its own as well.
    |
    | The properties are pretty self-explanatory.
